# Example 6

# Get a string of text from the user.
text1 = input("Enter a motivational quote: ")

# Call the built-in len function to get
# the number of characters in the text.
length = len(text1)

# Call the string upper method to convert
# the quote to upper case characters.
text2 = text1.upper()

# Call the built-in print function to print
# the length of the text and the text in all
# upper case for the user to see.
print(length, text2)
