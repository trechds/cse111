Program Title: Solar Energy Budget Calculation Program

Proposal Description:
I will develop a Python program that assists users in determining the feasibility and budget for installing solar panels based on various factors such as roof type, panel orientation, energy consumption, panel quantity, and more. It will be based in a website I created for that purpose.

Proposed Functions:

1. main(): The main function orchestrating the program flow, calling other functions as needed.
2. DetermineRoofType(): Function to prompt the user to select the type of roof (flat, pitched, etc.).
3. DeterminePanelOrientation(): Function to gather information on the orientation of the solar panels (south-facing, east-facing, etc.).
4. CalculateEnergyConsumption(): Function to calculate the user's energy consumption and required energy output from solar panels.
5. CalculatePanelQuantity(): Function to compute the number of solar panels needed based on energy requirements and panel specifications.
6. CalculateInverter(): Function to determine the quantity and power of inverters required for the solar panel setup.
7. DefinePanelArea(): Function to define the area occupied by the panels considering individual dimensions and structure.
8. DetermineInverterType(): Function to suggest whether to use micro-inverters or string inverters based on the setup.
9. DefinePanelStructure(): Function to determine the type of structure needed for fixing the solar panels based on the area or terrain.
10. CalculateBudget(): Function to compute the cost of solar panels, inverters, structure, and labor.
11. CalculateEnergyGeneration(): Function to calculate solar incidence, irradiation, and energy generation for each month.
12. GenerateProposal(): Function to create a commercial proposal for the client, displaying important project data.

Organization:
Each function will perform a specific task and be named accordingly. Functions will be organized logically, with reusable and easily testable functions focusing on calculations and returning results. Functions that interact with the user or display output will be designed to accept parameters and return values rather than directly accessing user input or printing results.

Testing Procedure:
I will test functions will be written for many program functions to ensure correctness and reliability. Pytest will be used to run test functions and verify the functionality of the program. Test cases will cover various scenarios to validate the accuracy of calculations and output generated by the program.

I will create the following testing functions:

1. test_determine_roof_type
2. test_determine_panel_orientation
3. test_calculate_energy_consumption
4. test_calculate_panel_quantity
5. test_calculate_inverter
6. test_define_panel_area
7. test_determine_inverter_type
8. test_define_panel_structure
9. test_calculate_budget
10. test_calculate_energy_generation
11. test_generate_proposal

This proposal outlines a comprehensive Python program aimed at assisting users in making informed decisions regarding solar panel installation by providing accurate budget estimates and project details. The program will be well-organized, with modular functions and thorough testing to ensure its effectiveness and reliability.

I will probably use the following modules:
1. datetime
2. csv
3. pytest
4. tkinter
5. math
6. os
7. sys
8. collections
9. random

For this project I will learn better how to write and call functions, and I will improve my skills in all we've learned in the course until now. It will be challenging, but I believe I can do it. I have some experience in Solar Energy area, I know how to calculate almost everything.
